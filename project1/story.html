                <p class="text-justify">I love learning new skills. I am also happy to meet other people who are exploring and challenging the limits of what they can do. I believe that there is no limit to learning. I have an old background in software development. I used to
                    code using Visual Basic. It was the only programming language I know when I graduated college since we used it heavily on our thesis. I remember how eager I was to solve a logical problem when I am dealing with programs. I was also
                    given the chance to teach it and help students get through their thesis in college. I migrated to the United States in 2009 and it took me a while to get my feet back into the IT industry. I worked in the Consulting Industry for over
                    5 years, working in IT and Security Compliance. </p>

                <p class="text-justify">I am currently working as a Cybersecurity Analyst at a retail corporation. I am enjoying this job and I would like to expand my skills in the software development in order to combine it with my current skills therefore strengthening my
                    aspirations of creating things that would provide protection of human data and privacy. My goal is to continue learning programming as much as I can. I always love to be a beginner. I treat myself as a beginner at all times in order
                    for me to transfer the knowledge and skills to anyone with much more patience and eagerness. Aside from computing, I also have a passion for art. I love drawing, painting with mediums such as watercolor and oil paint. I am also an
                    aspiring artist. I do have a long way to go in this industry. However, I only do it as a hobby.</p>

                <h1 class="display-5 fw-bold lh-1 mb-3 text-center ">How i got into Coding</h1>
                <p class="text-justify">As I have mentioned above, I graduated from a Computer Science degree ages ago. I learned coding from a friend who mentored me until the time he had me replace him on his job as a Systems Developer at a manufacturing company in the Philippines.
                    I learned to code more however when i left the job and then had to leave the country, I did not continue on learning coding and did not pursue a coding job. A few years later, I realized that I wanted to come back to learning coding
                    again.Hence the reason why I am doing the bootcamp.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">Aside from wanting to just learn new skills or updating my old skills, my passion is also to create things. Coding allows you to do such that. I believe that any person who would like to learn coding can also incorporate their other interest
                    into building something that is useful to others. I know that we all have the capacity to learn coding and other things that we put our dedication into. We should never stop learning. And we should always have the propensity to reach
                    out to others not only for help but also to collaborate. Creating something usable and coming up with new and amazing ideas can always be fun when you brainstorm with others. This is why i am here, doing my best to code and take on
                    the challenges of it as a very difficult skill to learn. And of course, I remind myself at all times, that everything is possible, even the impossible.
