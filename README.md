## 1. Description

This is a basic representation of my work while doing the Coding Bootcamp at UC Berkeley Extensions. The projects posted here are selected and required by the curriculum.
If you have any contributions to make, please reach out to me. I would love to hear your feedback and improve my work. I hope you enjoy my journey as much as I have enjoyed every bit of it.
